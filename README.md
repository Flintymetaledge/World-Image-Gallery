# World-Image-Gallery
World-Image-Gallery is fullstack php website based off the model view controller scheme. I allows you to register as a user and upload, view and vote on image saving them to a mysql database called gallery containing three tables: user, uservotes and image.

The web page was developed using Xampp feel free to download(https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) then just copy and overwrite htdocs folder to <dir>/xampp/htdocs and data folder to <dir>/xampp/mysql/data.
